```
The purpose of computers is human freedom.
I am going to help make people free through computers.
I will speak up against computer systems that are oppressive, insulting, or unkind, and do the best I can to improve or replace them, if I cannot prevent them from being bought or created in the first place.
I will fight injustice, complication, and any company that makes things difficult on purpose.
I will do all I can to further human understanding.
I will do what I can to make systems easy to understand, interactive wherever possible, and fun for the user.
